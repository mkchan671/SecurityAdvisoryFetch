A vulnerability in which custom variables are exposed to unauthorized users exists between versions 2.0.0 and 2.8.2.

These are commonly used to reference secrets in other configurations such as check commands to be able to authenticate with a service being checked. Icinga Web 2 displays these custom variables to logged in users with access to said hosts or services. In order to protect the secrets from being visible to anyone, it's possible to setup protection rules and blacklists in a user's role. Protection rules result in `***` being shown instead of the original value, the key will remain. Backlists will hide a custom variable entirely from the user. Besides using the UI, custom variables can also be accessed differently by using an undocumented URL parameter. By adding a parameter to the affected routes, Icinga Web 2 will show these columns additionally in the respective list. This parameter is also respected when exporting to JSON or CSV.

 ,icinga -- icinga,"Icinga is a monitoring system which checks the availability of network resources, notifies users of outages, and generates performance data for reporting. In versions prior to 2.11.10 and from version 2.12.0 through version 2.12.4, some of the Icinga 2 features that require credentials for external services expose those credentials through the API to authenticated API users with read permissions for the corresponding object types. IdoMysqlConnection and IdoPgsqlConnection (every released version) exposes the password of the user used to connect to the database. IcingaDB (added in 2.12.0) exposes the password used to connect to the Redis server. ElasticsearchWriter (added in 2.8.0)exposes the password used to connect to the Elasticsearch server. An attacker who obtains these credentials can impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify and delete information there. If credentials with more permissions are in use, this increases the impact accordingly. Starting with the 2.11.10 and 2.12.5 releases, these passwords are no longer exposed via the API. As a workaround, API user permissions can be restricted to not allow querying of any affected objects, either by explicitly listing only the required object types for object query permissions, or by applying a filter rule.",2021-07-15,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-32743, ,Not Yet Assigned

In versions of Sylius prior to 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1, part of the details (order ID, order number, items total, and token value) of all placed orders were exposed to unauthorized users. If exploited properly, a few additional information like the number of items in the cart and the date of the shipping may be fetched as well. This data seems to not be crucial nor is personal data, however, could be used for sociotechnical attacks or may expose a few details about shop condition to the third parties. The data possible to aggregate are the number of processed orders or their value in the moment of time. The problem has been patched at Sylius 1.9.5 and 1.10.0-RC.1. There are a few workarounds for the vulnerability. The first possible solution is to hide the problematic endpoints behind the firewall from not logged in users. This would put only the order list under the firewall and allow only authorized users to access it. Once a user is authorized, it will have access to theirs orders only. The second possible solution is to decorate the `\Sylius\Bundle\ApiBundle\Doctrine\QueryCollectionExtension\OrdersByLoggedInUserExtension` and throw `Symfony\Component\Security\Core\Exception\AccessDeniedException` if the class is executed for unauthorized user.",2021-06-28,5,CVE-2021-32720, ,Medium

In versions 2.6.0 and earlier, if a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any malicious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware. Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched. As a workaround, disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.",2021-06-16,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-32659, ,Not Yet Assigned

 ,restund -- restund,"Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.",2021-06-11,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-21382, ,Not Yet Assigned

 ,restund -- restund,"Restund is an open source NAT traversal server. The restund TURN server can be instructed to open a relay to the loopback address range. This allows you to reach any other service running on localhost which you might consider private. In the configuration that we ship (https://github.com/wireapp/ansible-restund/blob/master/templates/restund.conf.j2#L40-L43) the `status` interface of restund is enabled and is listening on `127.0.0.1`.The `status` interface allows users to issue administrative commands to `restund` like listing open relays or draining connections. It would be possible for an attacker to contact the status interface and issue administrative commands by setting `XOR-PEER-ADDRESS` to `127.0.0.1:{{restund_udp_status_port}}` when opening a TURN channel. We now explicitly disallow relaying to loopback addresses, 'any' addresses, link local addresses, and the broadcast address. As a workaround disable the `status` module in your restund configuration. However there might still be other services running on `127.0.0.0/8` that you do not want to have exposed. The `turn` module can be disabled. Restund will still perform STUN and this might already be enough for initiating calls in your environments. TURN is only used as a last resort when other NAT traversal options do not work. One should also make sure that the TURN server is set up with firewall rules so that it cannot relay to other addresses that you don't want the TURN server to relay to. For example other services in the same VPC where the TURN server is running. Ideally TURN servers should be deployed in an isolated fashion where they can only reach what they need to reach to perform their task of assisting NAT-traversal.",2021-06-11,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-21382, ,Not Yet Assigned

FastAPI versions lower than 0.65.2 that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack. In versions lower than 0.65.2, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the content-type header sent was not set to application/json or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. application/geo+json). A request with a content type of text/plain containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted. Requests with content type text/plain are exempt from CORS preflights, for being considered Simple requests. The browser will execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. This is fixed in FastAPI 0.65.2. The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the content-type header is application/json or another JSON compatible media type like application/geo+json. It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI, but if updating is not possible then a middleware or a dependency that checks the content-type header and aborts the request if it is not application/json or another JSON compatible content type can act as a mitigating workaround.",2021-06-09,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-32677, ,Not Yet Assigned

 ,wp-cli -- wp-cli,"WP-CLI is the command-line interface for WordPress. An improper error handling in HTTPS requests management in WP-CLI version 0.12.0 and later allows remote attackers able to intercept the communication to remotely disable the certificate verification on WP-CLI side, gaining full control over the communication content, including the ability to impersonate update servers and push malicious updates towards WordPress instances controlled by the vulnerable WP-CLI agent, or push malicious updates toward WP-CLI itself. The vulnerability stems from the fact that the default behavior of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` when encountering a TLS handshake error is to disable certificate validation and retry the same request. The default behavior has been changed with version 2.5.0 of WP-CLI and the `wp-cli/wp-cli` framework (via https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523) so that the `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()` method accepts an `$insecure` option that is `false` by default and consequently that a TLS handshake failure is a hard error by default. This new default is a breaking change and ripples through to all consumers of `WP_CLI\Utils\http_request()`, including those in separate WP-CLI bundled or third-party packages. https://github.com/wp-cli/wp-cli/pull/5523 has also added an `--insecure` flag to the `cli update` command to counter this breaking change. There is no direct workaround for the default insecure behavior of `wp-cli/wp-cli` versions before 2.5.0. The workaround for dealing with the breaking change in the commands directly affected by the new secure default behavior is to add the `--insecure` flag to manually opt-in to the previous insecure behavior.",2021-06-07,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-29504, ,Not Yet Assigned
 ,xen -- xen,"HVM soft-reset crashes toolstack libxl requires all data structures passed across its public interface to be initialized before use and disposed of afterwards by calling a specific set of functions. Many internal data structures also require this initialize / dispose discipline, but not all of them. When the ""soft reset"" feature was implemented, the libxl__domain_suspend_state structure didn't require any initialization or disposal. At some point later, an initialization function was introduced for the structure; but the ""soft reset"" path wasn't refactored to call the initialization function. When a guest nwo initiates a ""soft reboot"", uninitialized data structure leads to an assert() when later code finds the structure in an unexpected state. The effect of this is to crash the process monitoring the guest. How this affects the system depends on the structure of the toolstack. For xl, this will have no security-relevant effect: every VM has its own independent monitoring process, which contains no state. The domain in question will hang in a crashed state, but can be destroyed by `xl destroy` just like any other non-cooperating domain. For daemon-based toolstacks linked against libxl, such as libvirt, this will crash the toolstack, losing the state of any in-progress operations (localized DoS), and preventing further administrator operations unless the daemon is configured to restart automatically (system-wide DoS). If crashes ""leak"" resources, then repeated crashes could use up resources, also causing a system-wide DoS.",2021-06-11,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-28687, ,Not Yet Assigned
 ,xen -- xen,"x86: Speculative vulnerabilities with bare (non-shim) 32-bit PV guests 32-bit x86 PV guest kernels run in ring 1. At the time when Xen was developed, this area of the i386 architecture was rarely used, which is why Xen was able to use it to implement paravirtualisation, Xen's novel approach to virtualization. In AMD64, Xen had to use a different implementation approach, so Xen does not use ring 1 to support 64-bit guests. With the focus now being on 64-bit systems, and the availability of explicit hardware support for virtualization, fixing speculation issues in ring 1 is not a priority for processor companies. Indirect Branch Restricted Speculation (IBRS) is an architectural x86 extension put together to combat speculative execution sidechannel attacks, including Spectre v2. It was retrofitted in microcode to existing CPUs.

 ,envoy -- envoy,"### Description Envoy does not decode escaped slash sequences `%2F` and `%5C` in HTTP URL paths in versions 1.18.2 and before. A remote attacker may craft a path with escaped slashes, e.g. `/something%2F..%2Fadmin`, to bypass access control, e.g. a block on `/admin`. A backend server could then decode slash sequences and normalize path and provide an attacker access beyond the scope provided for by the access control policy. ### Impact Escalation of Privileges when using RBAC or JWT filters with enforcement based on URL path. Users with back end servers that interpret `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably are impacted. ### Attack Vector URL paths containing escaped slash characters delivered by untrusted client. ### Patches Envoy versions 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4, 1.15.5 contain new path normalization option to decode escaped slash characters. ### Workarounds If back end servers treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably and a URL path based access control is configured, we recommend reconfiguring back end server to not treat `%2F` and `/` and `%5C` and `\` interchangeably if feasible. ### Credit Ruilin Yang (ruilin.yrl@gmail.com) ### References https://blog.envoyproxy.io https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases ### For more information If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: * Open an issue in [Envoy repo](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/issues) * Email us at [envoy-security](mailto:envoy-security@googlegroups.com)",2021-05-28,not yet calculated,CVE-2021-29492, ,Not Yet Assigned
